    do_geoquery(connection, layer; geometrycols = ["SHAPE"])::DataFrame

Performs a `SELECT * FROM \$layer` operation on the database which `connection` points to,
but all `geometrycols` are additionally wrapped in `ST_AsBinary`, which converts geometries
from SQL format (which has an extra CRS indicator) to well known binary (WKB) format,
which is parseable by e.g. ArchGDAL (or WellKnownGeometry.jl, which is substantially slower).

WKB columns are given the suffix `_wkb` to differentiate them from the original columns.  

Results are returned as a DataFrame.

provided module `mod`.  This goes through ArchGDAL instead of being pure-Julia with WellKnownGeometry, since that's faster.
